        <h2>The Last Of Us Series</h2>
        <p>The Last of Us is an action-adventure-survival horror game series. The saga is set in a 
            post-apocalyptic United States ravaged by cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated 
            fungus of the genus Cordyceps. It follows several survivors, including Joel, a smuggler who 
            lost his daughter during the outbreak; Ellie, a young woman immune to the infection; and Abby, 
            a Seattle soldier who becomes embroiled in a conflict.</p>
